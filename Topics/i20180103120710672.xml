        <ul id="a2">
            <li id="a3">The use of <keypoint id="a4">spaces around punctuation</keypoint>. There is no need to define the use of spaces before a colon, an exclamation mark or inside quotes in English. In French, however, there are spaces inside quotes and before colons and exclamation marks. With the move to the web, some organizations have decided to remove spaces, while most now require the use of non-breaking spaces to avoid finding a colon or an exclamation point as the 1st character on a new line and to avoid the presence of widow or orphan quotes at the beginning or the end of a line. Also, if quotes are handled by elements such as &lt;lq&gt; and &lt;q&gt;, you need to specify if you expect the system to handle spacing with character replacement or not.</li>
            <li id="a5">The use of <keypoint id="a6">the gender neutral <i id="a7">they</i></keypoint>. In English, the sentence <q>Disqualify the candidate if they failed the test.</q> is a perfectly acceptable sentence. In most latin-based languages, using <i id="a8">they</i> for a single candidate is a grammatical error and it does nothing to solve the gender issue as there is a masculine and a feminine version of they. For example, with the Spanish Usted you can't avoid the fact that the adjectives that define the person are not gender neutral. For example, you'd say <q>if usted es pequeno</q> for a man and <q>si usted es pequena</q> for a woman.</li>
            <li id="a9"><keypoint id="a10">The voice of commands in instructions</keypoint>. In English, the imperative <q>Do this</q> and <q>Turn X on</q> makes total sense. In Spanish, for example, there is a need to define if the formal <q>usted</q> applies or the more informal <q>tu</q>. Some may say, in case of doubt, always use the formal form, but if your primary audience is a group of 10 years old, the use of <q>tu</q> will make you more credible and lovable.</li>
